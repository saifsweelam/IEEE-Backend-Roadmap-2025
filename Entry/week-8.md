## Task (30 pts.)

### Database Indexing (14 pts.)

1. Compare between clustered and non-clustered indexes. _(2 pts.)_
2. Assume we have a table called sales with columns (`id`, `rental_date`, `inventory_id`, `customer_id`) and the table has a clustered innoDB index on `id` (primary key) and a B+ tree index on (`rental_date`, `inventory_id`).

    A clustered index in innoDB contains the entire row (all columns) in its leaf nodes while a B+ tree index in innoDB contains only the indexed columns (`rental_date`, `inventory_id`) and the primary key (`id`) in its leaf node. 
    
    How many index lookups (index access) will each of the following queries perform? **From Instabug Internship Assesment 2024** _(6 pts.)_

    1. ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sales WHERE id = 5;
        ```
    2. ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sales WHERE rental_date = "2021-01-01";
        ```
    3. ```sql
        SELECT inventory_id FROM sales WHERE rental_date = "2021-01-01";
        ```
    4. ```sql
        SELECT rental_date FROM sales WHERE inventory_id = 126;
        ```
    5. ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sales WHERE inventory_id = 126 and rental_date = "2021-01-01";
        ```
3. You are given a database table `Orders` with the following schema: _(6 pts.)_
    ```sql
    Orders(
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT,
        product_id INT,
        quantity INT,
        order_date DATE,
        shipping_address TEXT,
        total_price DECIMAL(10, 2)
    )
    ```

    The database is currently experiencing performance issues due to frequent and slow queries. Indexing is not yet implemented on any column. You're not allowed to rewrite the queriesâ€”your only task is to improve performance by choosing which indexes to create.

    You have access to the following workload statistics:

    - A dashboard page loads the last 20 orders by `order_date` DESC and displays them to users.

    - A reporting job runs daily to calculate total revenue per product in the last 30 days.

    - A support tool looks up orders by `order_id` to help resolve customer issues.

    - An analytics system filters orders by `customer_id` to analyze customer purchasing behavior.

    - Occasionally, admins check for suspiciously high `total_price` values (e.g., above $10,000) across all orders.

    You're allowed to create at most 3 indexes (including composite ones).

    Which columns would you index, and why? Justify your choices based on query patterns and index design principles.


### Database Transactions (10 pts.)

1. You're designing the backend for a banking system. A customer initiates a fund transfer of $500 from Account A to Account B. The transfer operation is implemented as a single transaction: _(4 pts.)_

    Transaction Steps:
    1. Check if Account A has at least $500.
    2. Deduct $500 from Account A.
    3. Add $500 to Account B.
    4. Record the transaction in the logs.

    Unfortunately, a power outage happens right after step 2, before any of the remaining steps complete.

    - Which ACID properties are violated in this scenario? Explain briefly.
    - How can each ACID property be ensured or restored in this context?
    - Suppose two users try to transfer funds from the same account at the same time. Which ACID property would prevent data corruption?
    - Imagine the system crashes but recovers using a transaction log. Which ACID property makes this possible, and how?

2. You are a database engineer at a bank. Two transactions are being executed concurrently on the same database: _(6 pts.)_

    **T1**
    ```sql
    READ(A)  
    A = A + 100  
    WRITE(A)  
    READ(B)  
    B = B - 50  
    WRITE(B)
    ```

    **T2**
    ```sql
    READ(B)  
    B = B + 200  
    WRITE(B)  
    READ(A)  
    A = A - 150  
    WRITE(A)
    ```

    **Schedule**
    ```sql
    1. READ(A) by T1  
    2. READ(B) by T2  
    3. A = A + 100 by T1  
    4. B = B + 200 by T2  
    5. WRITE(B) by T2  
    6. WRITE(A) by T1  
    7. READ(B) by T1  
    8. B = B - 50 by T1  
    9. WRITE(B) by T1  
    10. READ(A) by T2  
    11. A = A - 150 by T2  
    12. WRITE(A) by T2
    ```

    - Is the schedule conflict-serializable? Justify your answer.
    - If not serializable, suggest a reordering of operations that would make the schedule conflict-serializable while maintaining as much concurrency as possible.



### Database Concurrency & Locks (6 pts.)

1. You're building a small library system. Two users, Alice and Bob, are trying to borrow the same book at the same time. _(4 pts.)_

    The transaction for borrowing a book looks like this:

    1. Check if the book is available.
    2. Mark the book as "borrowed". 
    3. Save the changes to the database.

    Right now, your system doesn't use any locks.

    - What could go wrong if Alice and Bob run this transaction at the same time without any locks?
    - If your system uses a shared lock for reading and an exclusive lock for writing, which type should be used at each step?
    - Why is it important to hold the lock until the transaction is done?

2. Explain the idea behind timestamp ordering algorithm. _(2 pts.)_
