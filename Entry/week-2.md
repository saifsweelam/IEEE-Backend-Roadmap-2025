## Task (20 pts.)

1. Create a schedule of your faculty lectures using markdown tables. _(3 pts.)_

2. Write the git commands needed for each of the following scenarios: _(6 pts.)_
    - You want to add all modified files to git staging without specifying each one of them.
    - You have a local repository and you need to add a remote with name `deploy` and url `https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git`.
    - You want to get the history of commits in the repository where each commit is represented by one line.
    - You try to make a commit but git asks you to enter your name and email first.
    - Your work is present on the branch `feature/chat` and you want to merge it with the branch `development`.
    - You realize that you want to add one more file to the last commit without creating a new commit.

3. What does the `HEAD` keyword refer to in git? _(2 pts.)_

4. What are the problems with this commit message? list all what you notice. _(2 pts.)_
    
    #### Commit message:
    Big change to fix everything that was broken

    #### Commit body:
    So I did a lot of stuff in this commit, including fixing bugs, adding new features, and refactoring code. Also cleaned up some old files. Not sure what exactly I did, but everything works now. Hope this doesn't break anything else. If it does, we'll just fix it later. Also, added some random changes to the config file, because why not? Should be good now. Oh, and I made a minor tweak to the UI, but I didn't check it fully. I think it's fine though. Whatever.

5. Which of these statements in **NOT** correct? and why? _(2 pts.)_
    - Git Bash provides Unix-like command line environment to windows users.
    - Git is a cloud-based service to store remote repositories.
    - `.gitignore` file contains paths that shouldn't be tracked by Git.
    - GitHub allows contributions of multiple developers on a single repository.

6. Create a new repository on your computer and add to it a `README.md` file, then push it to a new repository on GitHub. Inside the `README.md` file, write a tutorial about the steps you followed to create the repository and push it to GitHub. Your repository will be your future reference when you need to repeat these steps. _(5 pts.)_

7. **Pull Requests Excercise:** Follow the instructions declared [here](https://github.com/cat-backend-nodejs/i-can-pull-it). _(5 pts.)_
